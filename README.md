# Interactive webtool

## What is the purpose of this repository ? 

The repository can be used to display maps of Europe or of an Alpine area (French part of the Alps) showing the optimal tilt angles for a bifacial pv systems (composed of three rows) for various Ground Coverage Ratios and albedos. It is possible to select some parameters such as the scale (Europe or Alpine area), simulations parameters (albedo, Ground Coverage Ratio) to obtain the results and also the scale of the colorbar. It is also possible to display the annual irradiation received by the central module of the central row and the gain in irradiation by using optimal tilt angles rather than tilts equal to latitudes.

The repository can also be used to access an interactive map, showing the optimal tilt angles for each simulated tiles according to the selected GCR and albedo value and also the interpolated value of optimal tilt angles for any point in Europe. 

## How to access to the interactive webtool ? 

The interactive webtool is available via Binder at the following address : 

https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/apollineferry/Webtool/dd842c511463798d6a84d0f11af097c5b47b863d?urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Fwebtool_online_display_image_interpolation.ipynb

To access the maps, you have to run the above link on a internet explorer and wait for the loading of the tool. 
Then, you have to click on "webtool_online_display_image_interpolation.ipynb" in the left panel and to run all cells (Run --> Run all cells). 
The webtool is available after some computation time at the bottom of the page (you have to scrolldown).
